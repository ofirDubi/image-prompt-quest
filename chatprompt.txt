I am building a website with client in nodejs and server in python using flask.  The folder structure looks like this - 
-- site
---- client
------ index.html
---- server
------ server_code.py
---- data
------ images
The website sends a request to the server, and in the response receives a URL to an image. in the data/images folder.
e.g the server sends the path /data/images/img1.png.
I want to display the image in the client, but when i try doing so i get an error that the file cannot be found.
